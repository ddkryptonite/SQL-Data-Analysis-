# 1. Churn-Rate-SQL-Project
### Project Objectives
Four months into launching Codeflix, management asks to look into subscription churn rate. It’s early on in the business and people are excited to know how the company is doing. The marketing department is particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users. They provide a dataset containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels. Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.

Calculation of the churn rates for the two segments over the three month period. Which segment has a lower churn rate?





# 2. Customer-Segmentation-SQL-Project
### Project Objectives
The marketing department of Reputable Product Agency (RPA) is looking to segment the company users by a number of different criteria. In this context, a segment is a subset of users that meet different conditions. Segments are used to send marketing campaigns to users who meet specific criteria or to measure the performance of specific marketing campaigns. I tried to retrieve data under following circumstances with sql query.

+ The marketing department wants to send a Born in the ‘80s email to the appropriate users.

+ We are interested in the cohort of users that signed up prior to May 2017.

+ There was an A/B test performed on users that used cute animal clipart to encourage users to sign up. We’d like to see how the group that was shown ‘bears’ is performing.

A total of 4 advertising campaigns were run over this period. There were two sets of ad copy (set 1 and set 2) and both were run on two search engine sites (AAA and BBB). The resulting campaign values are:

+ AAA-1
+ AAA-2
+ BBB-1
+ BBB-2
  
+ Lets find all the emails of all users who received a campaign on website BBB.

+ Find all the emails of all users who received ad copy 2 in their campaign.

+ Find the emails for all users who received both a campaign and a test. These users will have non-empty entries in the campaign and test columns.
